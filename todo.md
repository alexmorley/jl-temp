#### Full file templates
Think about configuration (mainly to set sources).  
`TemplateSourcer` needs to handle multiple sources (source is part of hash so collisions are unlikely but currently the id => object mapping only takes a single source).
Make the MustacheEngine a bit more type strict.

#### Cell templates
Flesh out potential interfaces.
Test potential interfaces with some naive users.
Mimic Static DB structure of full files.
Build out a DB of lots of potentially useful cells.
